                <p>I am a geologist who is making a career change to become a developer.
                    I graduated from Brigham Young University in 2012 with my BS in Geology and 
                    2014 with my MS in geology. My introduction to coding began in graduate school 
                    where I used python and matlab to process large data sets and 
                    run statistical analyses on several thousand data points. I am particuarly interested 
                    in data scicence, working with, manipulating, and analyzing data. As a professional, I have worked 
                    extensively on project teams, am capable of working independently, meeting deadlines, and communicating
                    effectively with team members and clients.</p>
        
                <p> I am excited to become a full stack developer and transition my career onto an exciting new path! 
                    When I am not coding, I love spending time with my family, watching sports, cooking, 
                    gardening, and keeping African Cichlids. I have two children and have been 
                    married nearly eight years.</p>
