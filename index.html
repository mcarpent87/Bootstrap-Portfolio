          <p>I am a geologist who is making a career change to become a developer.
            I graduated from Brigham Young University in 2012 with my BS in Geology and 
            2014 with my MS in geology. My introduction to coding began in graduate school 
            where I used python and matlab to process large data sets and 
            run statistical analyses on several thousand data points. I am particuarly interested 
            in data scicence, working with, manipulating, and analyzing data. As a professional, I have worked 
            extensively on project teams, am capable of working independently, meeting deadlines, and communicating
            effectively with team members and clients.</p>
        
            <p> I am excited to become a full stack developer and transition my career onto an exciting new path! 
                When I am not coding, I love spending time with my family, watching sports, cooking, 
                gardening, and keeping African Cichlids. I have two children and have been 
                married nearly eight years.</p>
